                            Enjoy playing instruments such as the piano and guitar. I started out when I was 8 years old
                            and continued to progress by learning more instrumnents. I am currently working on Live
                            Performance for Church Worship Ministry for the spanish community. I enjoy every second of
                            it by learning new ways to make the community better.

                            Problem solving is one of the skills that I enjoy. Programming has contirbuted to breaking

                            a good challenge and it is a great feeling to accomplish it.

                            During my time at Flatiron School, I have learned to use frameworks that Javascripts would allow us to create custom routes such as Express.js. Learning this allowed me to create this application <a href="https://martinez-blog.herokuapp.com">Daily Journal </a> to allow users to create journals about their day to day lives.

                            React framework from Javascript allows users to create an application by creating components for each element of the page.
